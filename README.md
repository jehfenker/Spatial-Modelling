# Spatial-Modelling

In this repository, you can find random scripts with examples for species distribution modelling and projections to the past. :earth_americas:

 *  In the folder "Fenker et al, 2020 - Journal of Biogegraphy" you can access scripts to run analysis performed for the paper Fenker et al, 2020 - published on Journal of Biogeography https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.m0cfxpp05. Some scripts are originals and some are adapted from Dan Rosauer (https://github.com/DanRosauer/)

*   For example of species distribution modelling (SDM) and projections to the past in R (with package dismo) using the MaxEnt
    algorithm and BioClim variables, including loop for multiple species, please refer to the scripts "SDMs_maxent-in-dismo_jess.R" and "SDMs_project_paleomodels_maxent_in_dismo_jess.R".

*   If instead of BioCLim variables you want to use the dataset and past projections published by Beyer et al 2020 "High-resolution 
    terrestrial climate, bioclimate and vegetation for the last 120,000 years" on Scientific Data https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-0552-1
    please refer to the script "SDM_and_paleomodels_netcf_file.R".
